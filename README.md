# Sign-Language-Detection-
This YOLOv11-based model was trained on a custom-built action sign language dataset, created from scratch due to the lack of publicly available action-specific datasets. The dataset contains labeled images of various sign actions, enabling the model to detect and classify them in real time using OpenCV
